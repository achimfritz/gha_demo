GitHub Actions workflow for testing a TYPO3 CMS Extension 
=========================================================

This repository includes a Demo Extension for TYPO3 CMS and a fully functional GitHub Actions workflow
configuration to execute Unit-, Functional- and Acceptance-Tests

I have written a detailled blogpost about how to setup the GitHub Actions workflow at
https://www.derhansen.de/2020/05/typo3-ci-pipeline-with-github-actions.html

The blogpost explains 3 important steps you need to be aware of when using GitHub Actions for PHP applications
with Codeception Acceptance testing, so make sure you at least have a quick look at the TD;TR section.
